# LeetCodeQuestions
A repository of my working and most-efficient LeetCode solutions. The files can be searched through using their class title and number (for example, TS1.java refers to TS (Two Sum) + 1 (as in LeetCode problem #1). I will try to include the problem name and number as well as its time/space complexity for every answer. All solutions are in Java unless otherwise specified. Additionally, the space complexities for all solutions do NOT include space taken up for output (in other words, problems that require an array, map, etc. to be returned will be O(1) space complexity unless a SEPARATE data structure is required).
